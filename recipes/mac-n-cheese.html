    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Macaroni and cheese—also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly Cheddar sauce. 
        The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.</p>
